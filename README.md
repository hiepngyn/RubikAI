# RubikAI

An AI program that can solve rubiks cubes. (Work in progress still)

## What is RubikAI?
Current RubikAI is a python program that can create scrambles and from a trainded model solve the model.

## Project Aim
I wanted a project to learn more about ML and Artifical Intelligence. This is my introduction project to PyTorch as I try to build a program that can solve rubiks cubes. My first goal is to have a program that can solve predetermined scrambles that follow WCA (World Cubing Association) guidelines, but further along I want to explore different methods of solving such as CFOP, Roux, etc. In the end the aim for the project is to find the shortest solution for a puzzle with over 43 quantillion combinations. In theory all combinations can be solved within 20 moves, and I am to find them.

## Work In Progress
- Functioning AI model
- 3D Visuals
- Solving Notation Predictions
- Fully trained model with Website
